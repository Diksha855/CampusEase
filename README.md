# 🎓 CampusEase – One Platform for All Campus Updates

CampusEase is a beginner-friendly web project built for hackathons and learning purposes.  
It centralizes all college-related updates such as notices, events, deadlines, and resources into a single, easy-to-use platform.

---

## 🚩 Problem Statement

In many colleges, important information like:
- Notices
- Exam schedules
- Events
- Deadlines
- Resources

are shared across **notice boards, WhatsApp groups, and multiple websites**.

Because of this scattered system, students often **miss critical updates**.

---

## 💡 Proposed Solution

CampusEase provides a **centralized web platform** where students can:
- View all updates in one place
- Access information anytime, anywhere
- Use a clean, mobile-friendly interface

The project uses **JavaScript-based dynamic routing** to simulate a multipage website **without creating multiple HTML files**.
